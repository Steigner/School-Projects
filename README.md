# School-Projects

This repository summarizes some of the projects I worked on during my studies. Some of the projects are open for possible extensions, or are not completely polished. Some projects I would like to revisit and possibly expand.

Some projects also publish a semester report or presentation written in Czech. Each of the projects was dealt with in individual courses, where we has a variety of topics, so each sub-folder has the use of different programming languages, libraries and the topic itself.

## Topics

* 9GRA - Knight's Tour - Warnsdorff's Algorithm
* MPC-MID - Identification Nonlinear System
* VA1 - Simulating the temperature control of Home Smokehouse by Simulink
* VAI - Simple Translation Path Planning via RRT + A*
* VBC - Bio-inspired Computing algos
* VOB - Simple Inverse and Forward Kinematics 2DOF SCARA manipulator
* VRM - ABB RobotStudio Pick&Place, Visual Components Team Project
* VSC - Simple ANN Classifier, Adaptive ANN Modeling
* VSG - 4-BandStop Filter: Sample from TIMIT dataset
* VZI - A simple application of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding "air route"
