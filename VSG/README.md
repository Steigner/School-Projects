**Program was created as a final project course: Signals and Systems**

**Course aims**: To learn and understand the basic theory of signals and linear systems with continuous and discrete time. To introduce to random signals. The emphasis of the course is on spectral analysis and linear filtering â€“ two basic building blocks of modern communication and machine learning systems.

## Description
The main task of the program is to detect 4 interfering cos functions, and then to analyze and design a filter to filter out these interfering signals. Within this project a protocol with a detailed description of czech only was created. A filter with 4 band stops was selected for the solution, and the identification of interfering signals was done visually from the spectrogram. Each student was assigned a unique recording from the **TIMIT** database.
