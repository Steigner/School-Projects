This repository contain very simple approach of appliacation and comparation A* and RRT algorithm for path planning cobot UR3 from Universal Robots.

Repository contain 2 folders:

* path_planning - this ros package integrate to your catkin workaspace
* technical_report_and_presentation - folder contain technical report for this project and presentation about some ai problematics, both is in [[czech lang.]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_language).

### Note
Algorithms wasn't programmed in the most elegantly way(try better heuristics, in A* for lists Open/Close use dictonary, etc ...). Main reason is attempt to avoid common solutions and get some +points.
Time of finding solution is horrible, so in conclusion for real world application is better use modification of standalone algorithms as BiRRT etc... or programmed it in C++ or some faster prog. language alternativly Julia.

### Future work

* adit for ROS Noetic -> python3
* add Greedy best first-search, BiA*, ...
* add BiRRT, GPU RRT, ...
* add option to run in C/C++ or alternativly core compute of algo in Julia with communication by **RobotOS.jl**
* create own approach of trajectory with IK, FK and smoothing trajectory by Bezi√©r curves, etc ... (in this stage is use moveit linear trajectory)

### How to run?

Create catkin workspace, implicate dependent packages include **path_planning** from this repository.

#### Simulation in Gazebo
```javascript
Terminal
```
```console
user@user-pc:~$ roslaunch ur_gazebo ur3.launch
```
```console
user@user-pc:~$ roslaunch ur3_moveit_config ur3_moveit_planning_execution.launch sim:=true
```
```console
user@user-pc:~$ roslaunch ur3_moveit_config moveit_rviz.launch
```
```console
user@user-pc:~$ rosrun path_planning run.py
```
#### Real Robot
```javascript
Terminal
```
```console
user@user-pc:~$ roslaunch ur_robot_driver ur3_bringup.launch robot_ip:=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```
```console
user@user-pc:~$ roslaunch ur3_moveit_config ur3_moveit_planning_execution.launch
```
```console
user@user-pc:~$ roslaunch ur3_moveit_config moveit_rviz.launch
```
```console
user@user-pc:~$ rosrun path_planning run.py
```
